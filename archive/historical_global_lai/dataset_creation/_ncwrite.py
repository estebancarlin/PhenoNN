"""
Write an xarray Dataset to NetCDF from a *fresh* subprocess.

Why this exists
---------------
On some environments (the IPSL "spirit" cluster `.venv_ERA5`) the pip wheels
of ``netCDF4`` and ``h5py`` each bundle their OWN libhdf5. Once h5py is loaded
in a process — e.g. to read the ORCHIDEE PFTmap via ``engine="h5netcdf"`` or to
read THEIA H5 tiles via ``h5py.File`` — a subsequent ``netCDF4`` write in the
SAME interpreter corrupts the global HDF5 state and dies with
``RuntimeError: NetCDF: HDF error`` (inside ``Variable._put``).

Running the write in a **spawned** interpreter that never imports h5py
sidesteps the conflict. A plain ``multiprocessing`` fork would NOT help: the
child would inherit the parent's already-loaded (poisoned) HDF5 library, so we
launch a brand-new ``sys.executable`` via ``subprocess``.

The Dataset is materialised (``.load()``) and pickled to a temp file next to
the output (same filesystem, room on /data), then the child unpickles and
writes it. ``import xarray`` does not pull in h5py, and the write uses
``engine="netcdf4"``, so the child stays h5py-free.

    Write ``ds`` to ``out_path`` via a fresh h5py-free subprocess.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : xarray.Dataset
